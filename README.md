### Install dependencies
You need to install ```pygame``` package at first.
```
  python -m pip install pygame
```
This code was implemented and tested with python 3.8.

### How to execute and play
Main code is ```game.py```, so you need to execute it to play the game as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/hayanz/brave_gooreum-pygame.git
cd brave_gooreum_pygame
python game.py
```

### Copyrights of images and sounds
I designed the main character, 'gooreum' by myself, and the source of other images and sounds are annotated on the code.
